Climate change is a problem that could badly affect the future of humanity so we’d like to learn more about what technologists can do to tackle it. Fortunately, we recently came across [this extremely detailed essay](http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange) on what technologists and specifically software engineers can do to help.

It’s worth reading both for its insights about tackling climate change and because it suggests technical solutions that could be applied to problems in many different cause areas. Also, we’ve taken it as inspiration for our own work at Good Technology Project - we would love to create resources as good as this for each cause area we think is promising.
