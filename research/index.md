## Shallow reviews

Our goal is to help carve up the global problem space in to important sub-problems that are amenable to technological solutions. For that reason, some of the first material that we are producing is shallow reviews of promising problem areas.

## Interviews

We have used interviews with experts as a tool to learn more about an area. We've largely stopped doing this for now.

## Meta

We're still trying to work out what we should be doing and how we should be doing it. That means we need to think both about our own strategy and about strategy for technology entrepreneurs themselves.

## List of promising tech organizations

We're gradually coming across a variety of tech organizations that seem plausibly high impact. This is relevant both for founders who might want to learn from them, and for others who might want to consider working for them. We're keeping a list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ecr4NikKJBqtMjaLThGZ5srHzzDYU85DWEC_RnaqJgc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Notes and works in progress

We are aiming to be as transparent as we can in our research, and so we have made our research notes [publically available](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6jJhbNzdSRccExYV2xSZ2h3bUU). Please note that the material in this folder may be old, incomplete, or just plain wrong!
