## Who we are

We're two professional software developers, Richard Batty and Michael Peyton Jones. We want to find out how to do as much good as possible with technology, and since there isn't much information already out there, we're going to create it.

## What we are doing

Take a look at our [introductory blog post](/blog/2015/11/24/the-good-technology-project).

## Our values

* Evidence-based
* Altruistic
* Open-minded
* High quality

## Contact us

Do contact us if you're interested in participating in the project, and especially if you'd be willing to give an interview about a project that you're involved with.
