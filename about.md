## Who we are

We're two professional software developers, Richard Batty and Michael Peyton Jones. We want to find out how to do as much good as possible with our software careers, and since there isn't much information already out there, we're going to create it.

## What we are doing

Rather than try and discover everything ourselves, we're going to rely on existing experts and sources of information. We will:

* Interview experts in ethically important fields such as international development and find out ways that software could help those fields
* Interview experts in software fields to discover potentially beneficial technologies
* Research software projects that have had a large positive impact on the world

We'll write up all of our findings on our blog.

## Our values

* Evidence-based
* Altruistic
* Open-minded
* High quality
