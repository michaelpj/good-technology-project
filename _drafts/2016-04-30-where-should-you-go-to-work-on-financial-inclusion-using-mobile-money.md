We think that working on helping the world’s poorest people with their financial lives is possibly a very high impact area for programmers and tech entrepreneurs to go into. You can read our reasoning on this [here](/blog/2016/01/04/digital-financial-services-for-the-poor-shallow-overview/).

We’ve been working with a tech entrepreneur who’d like to work in this area, and he asked us ‘Where should I go to do this?’. This post is our best guess at an answer to this question after a couple of day’s research, based on the assumption that you want to build on top of an existing mobile money system. It’s important to note that mobile money is not the only possible digital financial system - digital financial services can be built on top of digital bank accounts and we will investigate this in future research.

## Main conclusion

We think you should go to Kenya, Tanzania, or Uganda if you want to work in this field.

## Reasoning

These countries have far higher use of mobile money among the poor than other countries for which we have data from [Financial Inclusion Insights](http://finclusion.org/):

| Country    | % of people below the poverty line who are active mobile money account holders |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nigeria    | 0%                                                                             |
| Bangladesh | 2%                                                                             |
| Pakistan   | 0%                                                                             |
| Tanzania   | 35%                                                                            |
| Uganda     | 24%                                                                            |
| Kenya      | 50%                                                                            |

For the two other countries for which [Financial Inclusion Insights](http://finclusion.org/) has data:

* In Indonesia, only 0.1% of the adult population has ever used mobile money (p.31 [here](http://finclusion.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/InterMedia-FII-Indonesia-wave-report-2-24-2015-updated.pdf))
* In India, only 0.3% of the adult population have accessed mobile money (p. 10 [here](http://finclusion.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/FII-India-_Wave-One-Research-Report.pdf)).

According to [GSMA’s 2015 State of the Industry report on mobile money](http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SOTIR_2015.pdf) “Of all sub-regions, East Africa recorded the highest level of mobile money penetration (55%)” (p.32)

These three countries also have lots of very poor people:

| Country  | % on < $1.90 per day ([poverty data](http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/region/SSA)) | Number on < $1.90 per day ([population data](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)) |
|----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Kenya    | 33%                                      | 15 million                                       |
| Tanzania | 47%                                      | 24 million                                       |
| Uganda   | 33%                                      | 12 million                                       |

[GiveDirectly’s reasoning](https://www.givedirectly.org/faq) about why they chose Kenya and Uganda sums this up:

> We chose these countries because both have large populations living in extreme poverty and yet are reachable through electronic payment systems. Kenya's top payment system, M-Pesa, is a global leader. Uganda's payments systems are still developing, letting us test our own ability to manage transfers under more challenging circumstances.

Further advantages of these countries would be that they have English as an official language and that there are other financial tech companies and charities in the region to seek advice from.

The downside of going to countries with a good existing digital financial services sector is that you may end up doing work that someone would be soon to do otherwise. For example, Kenya has the rapidly growing [M-Shwari](http://cbagroup.com/m-shwari/) bank account offering a combination of savings and loans built on top of M-Pesa. [It has grown from 2.9 million accounts in Q1 2013 to 9.2 million accounts in Q4 2014](http://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/Forum-How-M-Shwari-Works-Apr-2015.pdf) (p. 1).

## Alternatives

An alternative route is to go to a country where mobile money is on the rise. For example, [CGAP suggests](http://www.cgap.org/blog/new-data-finds-mobile-money-cusp-rwanda-and-ghana) that this is the case in Ghana and Rwanda and [GSMA says](http://www.cgap.org/blog/new-data-finds-mobile-money-cusp-rwanda-and-ghana) that in 2015 “the most impressive growth occurred in West Africa, where the percentage of mobile connections linked to a mobile money account increased by nearly six percentage points in 2015 to reach 19.6%” (p. 32).

Perhaps even greater impact could be had by trying to expand mobile money to regions that don’t have it. As [Lincoln Quirk](http://www.lincolnquirk.com/), co-founder of [Sendwave](https://www.sendwave.com/) [says](https://80000hours.org/2016/02/doing-good-through-for-profits-lincoln-quirk-and-wave/):

> A huge aspect of our potential impact is that we’re trying to create our own mobile money. Mobile money systems have transformed Kenya – Kenya is rapidly moving to a cashless economy (40% of its GDP already goes through M-Pesa) – reducing transaction costs, theft risk, and providing a platform on which lots of incredible products are built, including Wave, M-Kopa Solar and GiveDirectly. If we can create the M-Pesa of Africa we could move the needle on the rate of Africa’s development as a whole.

## Next steps for research

Big remaining questions:

* How important is it that the underlying financial system is mobile money as opposed to conventional digital banking? Is one easier to build on top of?
* Is it essential to have high smartphone penetration or can you build good systems for non-smartphones.
* What are the gaps in the market? Is anything neglected?
* Would it be better to work on expanding mobile money to areas that don’t have it?
* Would it be better to work for an existing organisation such as [Sendwave](https://www.sendwave.com/), [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), or [Segovia](http://www.thesegovia.com/).

Next steps for research:

* Talk to people in the field.
* Create a list of product types suggested by research organisations in this field.
