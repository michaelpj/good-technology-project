## Our research 

### Shallow reviews

Our goal is to help carve up the global problem space in to important sub-problems that are amenable to technological solutions. For that reason, some of the first material that we are producing is shallow reviews of promising problem areas.

### Interviews

We have used interviews with experts as a tool to learn more about an area.

## Our process

We are aiming to be as transparent as we can in our research, and so we have made our research notes [publically available](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6jJhbNzdSRccExYV2xSZ2h3bUU). Please note that the material in this folder may be old, incomplete, or just plain wrong!

We use Zotero for managing our sources, and you can access our shared library [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/goodtechnologyproject/items).
